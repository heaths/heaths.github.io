As a terminal junky, many years ago I customized my PowerShell `$profile` to
define a custom `function:prompt`. This included custom parsing for any `.git` directory
(even `.hg` for Mecurial!), and eventually any `.git` file to support worktrees
and submodules. It was fast and, last I knew, still powered some internal
environments we use at work.

The downside is that this doesn't work in bash. I do have PowerShell installed
in Ubuntu on WSL2, but I don't use it nearly as much as bash given bash is much
faster to start up. And since I'm developing more often in Ubuntu for pretty much
every language besides C# (and .NET in general) - because Visual Studio is so much
better than Visual Studio Code for managed code - I really wanted all the bells and whistles
of my custom profile. I was running powerline and know I can customize it too, but
keeping Python3 up to date with the right version that vim needs was something I was
growing tired of doing.

It was finally time to switch to [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/). I learned of this many
years ago but I don't think it existed when I first wrote my custom prompt. It did, however,
inspite me to rewrite how the prompt was coded to be more declaritive. Still, adding all the
same capabilities just didn't seem worth my time.

I ended up writing my own [custom theme](https://github.com/heaths/oh-my-posh) that somewhat
matches my old `function:prompt` with a few improvements I wanted. I can clone this to
_~/.config/oh-my-posh_ and set my _.bashrc_ or PowerShell `$profile` to initialize it with
the custom configuration.

To support starting a shell on a machine that does not yet have Oh My Posh, I moved
and refactored my old prompt to be [a module I can load as a fallback](https://github.com/heaths/profile/pull/2/files#diff-6a3cf8cae337c8ce108aa56ab5a133d64a409299287a0a4966f8e637c530eeaaR31-R36).

Overall, my `$profile` was better optimized so PowerShell starts faster, though starting a new
Go program each time my profile needs to render is a little slower - not enough to really
impact useability, though.

All these configuation directories - along with my vim configuration - are stored as Git
repositories to make it easier to sync across disparate machines as well as track changes
over time. Who knows: maybe one day I want to restore some old functionality.

After so many, many years with my custom prompt, it's a little hard to say goodbye,
but look at this new prompt (which will also continue to change):
