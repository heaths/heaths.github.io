  Why I pushed myself to earn 12 months straight of Strava's 7,000m Elevation Challenge,
  and how I'm on track to top 100km elevation in just a year's time.

A little over a year ago I went in for what I thought would be a routine physical.
Unfortunately, genetics caught up with me and I had some blockage in my arteries.
I wasn't going to end up with a heart attack like my paternal grandfather (dead by heart attack)
or my father, so I decided to change my lifestyle right then and there:
cut back (almost none) on added sugar - hard in this country - and reduce saturated fats.
I already excerised quite a bit, but decided to dedicate more to regular cycling instead of weekly hikes and
one or two rides a week.

When roads started getting icey, I decided to get a Zwift indoor trainer which I (mostly) enjoy.
That gave me ample time to work on more Strava badges - the harder ones, especially.

Around these parts, it's hard to avoid climbing on your bike so, with already strong legs, I leaned into it:
I started signing up each month for Strava's 7,000m (22,966ft) challenge.
I lost a bunch of weight and my legs got stronger to the point that training with friends and cycling teammates meant
frequently having to wait for them at the top of hills. I don't mind.
Fun to get out with people and (usually) to take a break after longer climbs.

I even finally road my first [Bike MS: Deception Pass Classic](https://events.nationalmssociety.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&eventID=1972) and set a [new course record on Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/12352769911#3267598232664522918); though, I plan to socialize more next year. It's not a race, but I wanted to push myself
on my first century ride and see what I could do over 100mi and over 5,000ft.

All this lead up to a lot of climbing over the past year to earn some badges, but more so to prove I could:

I'm on track to complete over 100km elevation and 5,000mi distance by EOY; however, after that I plan to back off a little.
Cycling indoor is great exercise, but it does get a little boring. I discovered audiobooks help,
but it's also mentally exhausting and I'm burning out after an average of 4-5 rides week - most often pusing myself.

I'll keep going, but I plan to tank any possibility of getting the 7,000m badge in January 2025.
I'll likely go for those badges in spring and summer months as I start training for the next charity ride(s).
