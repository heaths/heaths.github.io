I've been reading a lot about [ATProto](https://atproto.com) and following many accounts on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) like [@threddyrex.org](https://threddyrex.org) with interest. I had been following [standard.site](https://standard.site) as well and started thinking about how I might publish records using its lexicon to my hosted PDS. Then I discovered [Sequoia](https://sequoia.pub)!

It's a CLI that works with various static-site generators to publish records into your PDS - something I was just starting to think how I wanted to tackle it. This CLI is a good start, so I'm happy to try it out, file bugs, and even submit pull requests!

This post, if all is set up correctly, should be the first post published to the ATmosphere.
