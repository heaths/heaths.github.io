For [https://github.com](GitHub)-based projects, I most often just fetch `upstream/master` and branch from `FETCH_HEAD` to create topic branches, but occasionally I like to keep my local and `origin/master` branches up to date:

```bash
git pull -p --ff-only upstream master
git push # assumes local master is tracking origin/master
git fetch -p
```

In bash and [https://github.com/powershell/powershell](PowerShell) 7 I can do this in a single line separating commands with `&&`, but it's a lot to type over and over. Shells' history only lasts so long. Instead, I was able to combine this into a command alias in *~/.gitconfig*:

```bash
git config --global alias.sync "!git pull -p --ff-only upstream master && git push origin master && git fetch -p origin"
```

Now, I can just run the following:

```bash
git sync
```
