The [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) is a useful tool when working within git repositories with one or more remotes configured to use [GitHub](https://github.com). You can list issues and pull requests within your terminal, and even open pull requests:

```bash
gh pr create -f
```

This creates a pull request from the current branch - even prompting you to push it to a selected remote if not already in sync. It then outputs a link you can click on (often need to Ctrl+Click) and add details as you see fit, such as extra reviewers.

You can also add reviewers in the same command above, but I don't always remember all my colleagues' GitHub aliases. This is where another couple of `gh` commands come in handy: `gh api` and `gh alias`. I can define an alias that uses the current repo along with a partial name or login I specify, and will output a table of all matching users that can be assigned issues within that repository (people in one or more teams defined within the repository or owner, e.g. organization):

```bash
gh user scott
```

{% endraw %}

To configure an alias with mixed quotes, I found the easiest way currently is to modify the configuration file directly - at least as of `gh` version 1.9.2 (and it's been that way for as long as I can remember using `gh`.

1. Open *~/.config/gh/config.yml* where *~* is your user profile directory e.g. `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows or `$HOME` on other platforms including WSL. Create the file if it does not exist.
2. Add or edit the `aliases` section so it looks like this, keeping any existing contents that might be there already:
{% raw %}

   ```yaml
   # Aliases allow you to create nicknames for gh commands
   aliases:
       user: |-
         api graphql --paginate
           --template '{{range .data.repository.assignableUsers.nodes}}{{printf "%-16s" .login | color "green"}}{{.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
           -F owner=':owner' -F repo=':repo' -F name='$1' -f query='
             query ($repo: String!, $owner: String!, $name: String!, $endCursor: String) {
               repository(name: $repo, owner: $owner) {
                 assignableUsers(first: 50, after: $endCursor, query: $name) {
                   nodes {
                     login
                     name
                   },
                   pageInfo {
                     hasNextPage
                     endCursor
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           '
    ```

{% endraw %}
3. Save and close the file.

Now whenever you run a command like `gh user <name>` you'll see output like the following for matching names or logins:
