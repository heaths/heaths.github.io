While I haven't yet left [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrhestew), I've joined many in the
[#TwitterMigration](https://fosstodon.org/web/tags/twittermigration) to Mastodon or, more specifically,
[Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@heaths). While I appreciate it's a federated network of nodes - much like IRC of old -
I am slightly disappointed I either deleted or let lapse my old mastodon.social account I opened many years ago when it
first started going public. Being on that instance is like a badge of honor, but a pointless digital badge, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

If you're new to Mastodon (rather, the Fediverse) or want to learn about it, see <https://joinmastodon.org/>.
