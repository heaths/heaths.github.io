The new Azure SDK [has a lot of new features](https://aka.ms/azsdkvalueprop)
that make it worth migrating from Microsoft.Azure.* to Azure.* packages.
Logging is greatly improved and is consistent across client libraries. All
clients will log request and response information automatically when
AppInsights or OpenTelemetry is configured.

You can also enable logging manually using either ETW applications like
*logman.exe*, or standard tracing tools like `dotnet trace` as shown in the
example below.

## Setting up

You need to set up your environment for `dotnet trace`. If you need to install
the dotnet SDK, see <https://dot.net>. Once you have dotnet installed, run
the following to install dotnet-trace:

```shell
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-trace
```

You can test your installation by running the following:

```shell
dotnet trace --help
```

If that doesn't work, try restarting your terminal.

Now you need to create a simple console project:

1. Run the following commands to create the project:
   ```shell
   dotnet new console -o sample
   cd sample
   dotnet add package Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets
   dotnet add package Azure.Identity
   ```
2. Replace the contents of *Program.cs* with the following:
   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.Diagnostics;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;
   using Azure.Identity;
   using Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets;
   namespace logger
   {
       class Program
       {
           static async Task Main(string[] args)
           {
               var url = args.Length > 0 ? args[0]
                   : Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_KEYVAULT_URL")
                   ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Azure Key Vault URL required.");

               using (var p = Process.GetCurrentProcess())
               {
                   Console.WriteLine("Run the following command and press Enter to continue:");
                   Console.Write("dotnet trace collect -p {0} --providers Azure-Core", p.Id);
                   Console.ReadLine();
               }

               var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
               var options = new SecretClientOptions
               {
                   Diagnostics =
                   {
                       // Set to true to log content. Default is false.
                       IsLoggingContentEnabled = true,
                   },
               };

               var client = new SecretClient(new Uri(url), credential, options);

               KeyVaultSecret secret = await client.SetSecretAsync("test-secret", "secret-value");
               Console.WriteLine(secret.Value);
           }
       }
   }
   ```
3. Make sure it builds by running:
   ```shell
   dotnet build
   ```

## Tracing network calls

Because we've now built a console application you'll need two terminals.

1. In one terminal, run:
   ```shell
   dotnet run -- <Key Vault URL>
   ```
   Unless you already have Azure credential environment variables defined, you should be
   prompted to authenticate using your browser and possibly a device code.
2. In the other terminal, copy, paste, and run the command output, e.g.:
   ```shell
   dotnet trace collect -p 1234 --providers Azure-Core
   ```
3. Back in the first terminal, press **Enter**.

This will, by default, write to *trace.nettrace* in the current directory.
You can use tools like [PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview/releases/latest)
to view trace information, including content if you set `IsLoggingContentEnabled`
to `true` as shown in the example above.

## More tracing

Some other clients may trace additional details. While Azure SDK is working
on improving documentation, you can browse source code for interesting client
libraries in [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net). Newer
client libraries (a.k.a. "track 2") can be found in _sdk/**/Azure.*_ directories.
