The following archive of old articles I've written on other sites may no longer be accurate or considered "best practice",
may not have images or source code, and may just be naive. Many are very old and we all learn. Still,
I wanted to save these articles that I feel were an important part of my journey.

These do not represent a comprehensive trove of articles I've written - I've written far too many over the years - but
are a few highlights I feel worth preserving with most formatting intact: typos and all.

To see more articles / posts I've written over the years on sites that do not have plans, that I know of, to shut down, visit:
